# MCP Integration UX — Design

**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Status:** spec
**Trigger:** [Roadmap Item 5](../ROADMAP.md) → [Pi integration spike](../research/2026-05-26-pi-integration-spike.md) recommends starting here as the lowest-risk entry to the Pi ecosystem. Brainstorm clarified that the goal is **general-purpose MCP support**, not Pi-specific packaging.

## Goal

The MCP server in [`desktop/src/mcp/`](../../desktop/src/mcp/) already exposes 9 tools + 2 resource types and works end-to-end. What's missing is **discoverability and connection** — today the only way to use it is by manually editing some MCP client's config file with absolute paths that break the moment the app moves.

Ship a Settings sub-page that auto-configures the major MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor) so an existing CarbonInk user can opt them into reading their carbon data in two clicks. Stay general-purpose: no Pi-specific extension packaging, no marketing surface, no Skill.md.

Strategic context: introducing Pi/MCP to carbonink is **internal architecture learning, not a customer-facing Pi push** (recorded as a project-scope principle in the user's agent memory; relevant for all downstream Pi roadmap items). v1 of Item 5 is the cheapest credible proof we understand how to expose carbonink data through a standard agent protocol.

## Architecture

Three layers, mirroring the existing IPC handler pattern:

```
┌─ desktop/src/main/services/mcp-integration-service.ts ───┐  ← new
│   detectClients(): Record<ClientId, ClientStatus>         │
│   configureClient(id): { configPath, backupPath }         │
│   removeClient(id): { configPath, backupPath? }           │
│   getServerEntry(): { command, args, env }                │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ▲
                          │ IPC
┌─ desktop/src/main/ipc/handlers/mcp-integration.ts ───────┐  ← new
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ▲
                          │
┌─ desktop/src/renderer/routes/settings/integrations.tsx ──┐  ← new
│   Master toggle + per-client rows                         │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Reused unchanged:
• desktop/src/mcp/* — the MCP server itself
• vite.mcp.config.ts — its build script
• desktop/src/main/services/audit-event-service.ts — for traceability
• desktop/messages/* — paraglide i18n
```

The MCP server is **spawned on demand** by each MCP client over stdio; nothing runs from CarbonInk's side until a client connects. That's a property of the existing server, not a design choice we're making. Implication: the master toggle in Settings does NOT start/stop a process — it governs whether the Settings page lets the user add/remove client config entries. The server itself is reachable as long as the binary path on disk is valid.

### Runtime: `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`

Production users do not have `node` on PATH. We exploit Electron's built-in Node runtime by passing `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` as an env var, which makes the Electron binary behave as a vanilla Node process:

```json
{
  "command": "<process.execPath>",
  "args": ["<unpacked path to out/mcp/index.js>"],
  "env": { "ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE": "1" }
}
```

This eliminates the "requires node on PATH" support burden entirely. The price: a hard dependency on the user's installed CarbonInk binary location, which is fine — these clients only exist because CarbonInk is installed.

### Path resolution (dev vs production)

| | binary (`command`) | server (`args[0]`) |
|---|---|---|
| Dev (`pnpm dev`) | `process.execPath` (electron-vite's Electron) | `path.join(app.getAppPath(), 'out/mcp/index.js')` |
| Production | `process.execPath` (CarbonInk.app/.exe) | `path.join(process.resourcesPath, 'app.asar.unpacked/out/mcp/index.js')` |

Distinguished via `app.isPackaged`. Dev mode still lets you configure clients (handy for local debugging) but adds a warning toast: "Dev build paths. Reconfigure after switching to a packaged build."

## Components

### `mcp-integration-service.ts` (main process)

```ts
type ClientId = 'claudeDesktop' | 'claudeCode' | 'cursor' | 'pi';

type ClientStatus =
  | { installed: false }
  | { installed: true; configured: false; configPath: string }
  | { installed: true; configured: true;  configPath: string;
      entryDiffersFromCurrent: boolean };

type ServerEntry = {
  command: string;
  args: string[];
  env: { ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE: '1' };
};

interface McpIntegrationService {
  detectClients(): Promise<Record<ClientId, ClientStatus>>;
  configureClient(id: ClientId): Promise<{
    configPath: string;
    backupPath: string | null;  // null when noChange
    noChange?: true;
  }>;
  removeClient(id: ClientId): Promise<{
    configPath: string;
    backupPath: string | null;
  }>;
  getServerEntry(): ServerEntry;
}
```

Pi's `ClientStatus` is special: `installed` reflects whether `~/.pi/` exists, but `configured` is always `false` and `configureClient('pi')` throws `PiNotSupportedError` — the UI hides the Configure button and renders a "View setup instructions" link instead.

Per-path mutex via `Map<string, Promise<void>>` serializes overlapping calls to the same config file.

### `ipc/handlers/mcp-integration.ts`

Three IPC channels matching the service API. Zod schemas validate input (`ClientId` enum). Reuses [`sanitize.ts`](../../desktop/src/main/ipc/sanitize.ts) for path-bearing responses.

### `routes/settings/integrations.tsx`

New Settings sub-page accessible from the existing Settings shell. Layout:

```
┌─ Integrations ────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [ ] Enable MCP integration                                 │
│      Let external AI tools read (and write) your carbon    │
│      data through the Model Context Protocol.              │
│                                                            │
│ Server binary:  /Applications/CarbonInk.app/...            │
│ Server script:  .../app.asar.unpacked/out/mcp/index.js     │
│                                                            │
│ Clients                                                    │
│ ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Claude Desktop      [Configured ✓]    [Reconfigure]   │ │
│ │ Claude Code         [Not configured]  [Configure]     │ │
│ │ Cursor              [Not detected]    [—]             │ │
│ │ Pi                  [Manual setup]    [View guide →]  │ │
│ └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The "Server binary" / "Server script" rows are intentionally exposed for debugging — when a configured client fails, the first question is always "is that path still valid?" and answering it should not require devtools.

## Data flow

### Detect (on page mount + manual refresh)

Per client: stat the canonical config path; if present, parse and look for an entry matching either `"carbonink"` (the canonical key) or any key whose `args[0]` resolves to our `out/mcp/index.js`. The second check catches legacy `"carbonbook"` keys and user-renamed entries.

If found and the resolved entry equals `getServerEntry()` byte-for-byte → `configured: true, entryDiffersFromCurrent: false`. Otherwise `entryDiffersFromCurrent: true` and the button reads "Reconfigure."

### Configure

1. Read existing config (or `{}` if missing). Create parent dir if needed (mode 0755).
2. If existing carbonink entry equals target → return `{ noChange: true }`, no backup, no write.
3. Otherwise: write `<path>.carbonink-bak-<ISO timestamp>` containing the pre-merge content.
4. Mutate the parsed object: insert `mcpServers.carbonink = getServerEntry()`. If a legacy key was found (different name, same path), delete it in the same write.
5. Atomic write: `fs.writeFile(<tmp>, ...)` then `fs.rename(<tmp>, <final>)`.
6. Audit-log `mcp_integration.configure` with `{ clientId, configPath, backupPath, replacedKey? }`.
7. Return `{ configPath, backupPath }`.
8. Toast: **"Configured `<ClientName>`. Restart `<ClientName>` to apply."**

### Remove

Mirror of configure: backup, delete `mcpServers.carbonink`, atomically write. If `mcpServers` becomes `{}`, delete the key entirely to keep the config tidy. No-op if entry was never present.

### Backup retention

After each backup write, list `<path>.carbonink-bak-*` files for the same target, sort by mtime desc, delete all but the newest 3. Never touch backups whose name doesn't match our pattern.

## Per-client config formats

### Claude Desktop

```
macOS:    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
Windows:  %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
Linux:    ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Top-level shape: `{ mcpServers: { [key]: { command, args, env? } }, ... }`. We write only `mcpServers.carbonink`; everything else is preserved.

### Claude Code

```
macOS/Linux:  ~/.claude.json
Windows:      %USERPROFILE%\.claude.json
```

Top-level is a large config object with `mcpServers` as one key. Same entry shape as Claude Desktop. We touch only `mcpServers.carbonink`; the dozens of other Claude Code keys (cached experiments, onboarding state, oauth tokens, etc.) are preserved verbatim. **Critical**: never parse-then-stringify in a way that drops unknown keys.

### Cursor

```
macOS/Linux:  ~/.cursor/mcp.json
Windows:      %USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json
```

Top-level shape: `{ mcpServers: {...} }`. Entry shape is more flexible than Claude (supports both stdio `{command, args, env}` and HTTP `{type, url, headers}`); we write stdio identical to the Claude format.

### Pi (deferred)

Pi's coding-agent docs ([packages/coding-agent/docs](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/docs)) have no `mcp.md`. Pi reaches MCP through a bridge extension like [mavam/pi-mcporter](https://github.com/mavam/pi-mcporter), not a unified `mcpServers` config. Writing Pi's config in v1 means installing and configuring that extension — meaningfully more work and a Pi-specific code path.

v1 surfaces a **"View Pi setup guide"** link that opens a docs page explaining how to install pi-mcporter and register the carbonink server manually. When Pi gains native `mcpServers`-style config (likely soon given the ecosystem direction), promote it to first-class auto-configure.

## Naming conflicts and historical entries

The repo currently has three names for the same thing:

- **`carbonbook`** — git repo + spike doc filenames
- **`carbonink`** — `package.json` name, productName, MCP server's `Server({ name: 'carbonink' })`
- **`CarbonInk`** — user-facing brand

We standardize on **`carbonink`** for the MCP config key. Detection treats `carbonbook` (and anything whose `args[0]` matches our `out/mcp/index.js` regardless of key name) as a stale prior install; "Reconfigure" deletes the old key and writes the canonical one in the same atomic write.

If the user has a legitimate `carbonink` key pointing at a different MCP server (extremely unlikely but possible), Reconfigure pops a confirmation: "An entry named 'carbonink' exists pointing at `<other-path>`. Overwrite?"

## Error handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Config file is invalid JSON | Detection returns `{ error: 'invalid_json', path }`; UI shows the path with a hint to fix or back it up manually. We never try to repair. |
| Config file is read-only | Error toast with the OS error message verbatim. |
| Backup write fails | Abort the whole operation; main config untouched. |
| Atomic write fails after backup wrote | Tmp file left on disk; path logged; backup remains. User can restore from backup if needed. |
| `out/mcp/index.js` missing on disk | Detection returns all clients disabled; Settings shows red banner "MCP server file missing — reinstall CarbonInk." No Configure buttons render. |
| User moved CarbonInk.app between Configure and Reconfigure | Detection's `entryDiffersFromCurrent` flag flips → button text changes to "Reconfigure" → click rewrites with new path. |
| Two simultaneous Configure clicks | Per-path mutex serializes; second call returns idempotent `{ noChange: true }`. |
| Client doesn't pick up new config | Out of scope — toast tells user to restart the client. |

## Non-functional changes outside this feature

### `electron-builder.yml` — asarUnpack

The bundled MCP server script must be **outside** `app.asar` so MCP clients can `spawn` it. Add to [`electron-builder.yml`](../../desktop/electron-builder.yml):

```yaml
asarUnpack:
  - out/mcp/**
```

Without this, packaged builds fail at runtime with `ENOENT` when a client tries to spawn the server. Spike doc captured this as a hidden risk; this design promotes it to a hard requirement.

### Documentation page for Pi manual setup

A short markdown page describing the pi-mcporter route, linked from the "View Pi setup guide" button. v1 ships it as an inline modal/popover inside the Settings page (no new marketing-site URL needed — keeps the spec self-contained). If we later want a public URL, promote it to `cloud/web/src/pages/docs/`.

## Testing

### Unit — `tests/main/services/mcp-integration-service.test.ts`

`detectClients`:
- All three (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor) absent → all `installed: false`
- Present but `mcpServers` missing → `installed: true, configured: false`
- Present with `mcpServers.carbonink` matching target → `installed: true, configured: true, entryDiffersFromCurrent: false`
- Present with legacy `carbonbook` key pointing at our script → `configured: true, entryDiffersFromCurrent: true`
- Present but invalid JSON → `{ error: 'invalid_json' }`

`configureClient`:
- First write: parent dir missing → created; no backup (no origin file)
- Second write with same content → `{ noChange: true }`, no backup, no write
- Different content → backup created, atomic rename happened, audit event logged
- Backup write fails → throws; main file unchanged
- Legacy key present → deleted in same write as new key inserted
- Concurrent calls to same client → second resolves with no-change

`removeClient`:
- Removes the key; if `mcpServers` empty afterward, removes that too
- No entry present → no-op

Backup retention: write 5 backups → only newest 3 remain on disk.

**Test fixtures**: real `fs` against `os.tmpdir()` per test, never mocked. Atomic write semantics must be exercised for real.

### IPC — `tests/main/ipc/mcp-integration-handlers.test.ts`

Sanity tests against the same patterns as [`tests/main/ipc/settings-handlers.test.ts`](../../desktop/tests/main/ipc/settings-handlers.test.ts). Zod validation rejects invalid `clientId`.

### Renderer — `tests/renderer/settings-integrations.test.tsx`

React Testing Library:
- Master toggle off → all Configure buttons disabled
- Configure click → IPC mock invoked, loading state, success toast
- Status chip text matches client state
- Pi row shows "View guide" link instead of Configure

### Manual smoke (release notes)

```
1. pnpm desktop:build && open out/mac/CarbonInk.app
2. Settings → Integrations → MCP — verify Claude Desktop/Code/Cursor detection
3. Click Configure Claude Desktop → verify ~/Library/.../claude_desktop_config.json updated
4. Restart Claude Desktop — verify the carbonink MCP server is listed and lists 9 tools
5. In Claude Desktop ask "list all questionnaires" — verify real data returns
6. Move CarbonInk.app to a different folder; reopen Settings — verify Reconfigure
7. Click Remove — verify entry deleted; backup file remains on disk
```

### Out of testing scope

- E2E with real Pi/Claude Code/Cursor (CI can't install all three)
- Windows path edge cases (manual smoke on Windows before release)
- MCP server's own functional tests (covered indirectly through existing service tests)

## Out of scope (explicit)

- ❌ Pi auto-configure (deferred until Pi adds native `mcpServers` config)
- ❌ Skill.md / Pi extension packaging (against the internal-architecture rationale recorded in agent memory)
- ❌ npm publish of any package
- ❌ First-run popup / auto-detect-and-prompt (deferred to v1.x — design B from brainstorm)
- ❌ Default-on auto-configure (rejected; violates least surprise)
- ❌ Runtime health monitoring of MCP server (user discovers issues through their client)
- ❌ Per-tool permission prompts (`set_answer`, `create_activity` ship unguarded — audit-event + undo-manager cover the recovery story)
- ❌ Migration of user-created entries pointing at third-party MCP servers (only legacy carbonink/carbonbook keys get auto-rewritten)
- ❌ iCloud-Drive sync of `mcpServers` across multiple Macs (non-issue; configs are local)
